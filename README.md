# Derivio

Derivio is a web platform for pricing financial options using three quantitative methods: 

1. Black-Scholes model
2. Monte Carlo simulation
3. Binomial model

The app fetches data for 105,000+ stocks and provides an interactive interface for analysis and comparison.

## Overview
Derivio allows users to compute theoretical option prices for both call and put options under various assumptions and market conditions.  
It’s implemented in Python 3.9 and built with Streamlit for an intuitive, browser-based experience.

## Implemented Models

### 1. Black-Scholes Model
A closed-form solution for European options, based on stock price, strike price, time to maturity, risk-free rate, and volatility.

### 2. Monte Carlo Simulation
A stochastic simulation technique that generates thousands of possible price paths to estimate an option’s expected payoff.

### 3. Binomial Model
A discrete-time framework that models the underlying price as a binomial tree, calculating option values step by step until expiration.
